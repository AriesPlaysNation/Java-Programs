<h2>Lottery</h2>
<p>This app picks a random number between 000 and 999 and asks the user to pick a number between 000 and 999. If the user guesses all 3 numbers correctly in order they win the grand prize. If they guess all 3 numbers, not in the same order, they win the medium prize. If they guess 1 number correctly, they win the smallest size. And then of course if they guessed no numbers correctly, then they win nothing.</p>

<h2>Payroll</h2>
<p>Asks the user for a general employees name, hours, pay as well as federal and state tax, and calculates the employees payroll information</p>

<h2>Pentagon</h2>
<p>Ask the user for a radius and the app configures the area of a pentagon and displays back to the user.</p>
